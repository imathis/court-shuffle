# Court Shuffle

**üéæ Try it now: [courtshuffle.com](https://courtshuffle.com)**

Playing Tennis or Pickleball with a big group? Use CourtShuffle to randomly assign courts and partners.

## How It Works

1. **Choose Format** - Supports both singles and doubles play
2. **Select Courts** - Choose the court numbers you'll be playing on
3. **Add Players** - CourtShuffle creates a virtual deck of cards based on your setup
4. **Draw Cards** - Players draw cards to determine their court and partner assignments

### Card System

- **Court Number** - The card number (3, 4, 5, etc.) indicates which court to play on
- **Partner Matching** - Red suits (‚ô¶Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è) pair together, black suits (‚ô†Ô∏è‚ô£Ô∏è) pair together

#### Examples:

- Players drawing **3‚ô¶Ô∏è** and **3‚ô•Ô∏è** are **partners on court 3**
- Players drawing **4‚ô†Ô∏è** and **4‚ô£Ô∏è** are **partners on court 4**
- Players drawing **5‚ô¶Ô∏è** and **5‚ô†Ô∏è** are **opponents on court 5**

### Multi-Device Sync

Got a really big group? Share the deck across multiple devices! Everything stays perfectly synchronized - no one will draw the same card twice.

## Usage

### Basic Gameplay

1. **Configure Game**: Set number of courts and add players
2. **Start Game**: Generate card deck based on configuration
3. **Draw Cards**: Players are assigned to courts via card draws
4. **Track Progress**: Navigate through rounds and manage court status

### Local vs. Synchronized Games

- **Local Mode**: Games are stored locally, work offline
- **Sync Mode**: Games can be shared across devices with real-time updates
- **Graceful Degradation**: App automatically falls back to local-only if sync fails

### Game Sharing

- Games can be shared via unique slugs when sync is enabled
- QR codes are generated for easy mobile sharing
- Multiple devices can connect to the same game session

## Deployment
